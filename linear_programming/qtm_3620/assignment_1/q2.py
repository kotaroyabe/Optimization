# QTM3620 Assignment 1 Question 2

"""
Question  2: [35 points] American Auto is evaluating their marketing plan for
the sedans, SUVs, and  trucks  they  produce.  A  TV  ad  featuring  the  SUV
has  been  developed.  The  company  estimates  each  showing  of  this
commercial  will  cost  $90,000  and  has  no  effect  of  the  sales  of
sedans, increases the sales of SUVs by 3% but reduces sales of trucks by 1%. The
company also has a print ad campaign developed that it can run in various
nationally distributed magazines at a cost of $20,000 per title. It is estimated
that each magazine title the ad runs in will increase the sales  of  sedans,
SUVs,  and  trucks  by  2%,  1%,  and  4%,  respectively.  The  company desires
to increase sales of sedans, SUVs, and trucks by at least 3%, 14%, and 4%,
respectively, in the least costly manner. (Note: In your calculations, consider
the costs at the tens of thousands, so $9 for tv ad and $2 for the magazine).

a. Determine the decision variables and formulate an LP model for this problem.
b. Sketch the feasible region and show the level curve(s).
c. Determine  the  optimal  solution  and  the  optimal  objective  value  based  on  the  graph  (No Excel solution should be submitted)
